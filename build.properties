## 2. Switches for common tasks

version = 2.1

## Allows you to switch off the compilation of the internal image
## codecs which depend on Sun-private classes. Setting this to true
## enabled compatibility with non-Sun Java implementations such as
## Kaffe, IKVM, GCC/GCJ or even Apache Harmony (i.e. system which 
## are based on GNU Classpath, for example).
# internal-codecs.disabled = false

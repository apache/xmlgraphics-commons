What is Apache XML Graphics Commons?
---------------------------------------

It is a place where the Apache Batik and Apache FOP share commonly used 
components. Many components in here are also usable and useful stand-alone.
    
Documentation
---------------------    

The documentation can be found under:
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/commons/

Where to get help?
---------------------    

Please subscribe to the general@xmlgraphics.apache.org mailing list by sending
an empty mail to general-subscribe@xmlgraphics.apache.org. All you questions
about XML Graphics Commons will be answered there.    

Please report bugs to bugzilla at http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/


How do I build Apache XML Graphics Commons?
----------------------------------------------

If you've downloaded a binary distribution of Apache FOP or Apache Batik, 
you don't need to build XML Graphics Commons. It is distributed with these
two products.

Otherwise, install Apache Ant (http://ant.apache.org) and run "ant" from the
command-line in the directory where you find "build.xml".

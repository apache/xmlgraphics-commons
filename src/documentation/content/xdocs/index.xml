      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        Apache XML Graphics Commons is a library that consists of several reusable components 
        used by <a href="ext:batik">Apache Batik</a> and <a href="ext:fop">Apache FOP</a>. 
        Many of these components can easily be used separately outside the domains of SVG 
        and XSL-FO. You will find components such as a PDF library, an RTF library, Graphics2D 
        implementations that let you generate PDF &amp; PostScript files, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apache XML Graphics Commons has only just begun. It's in the process of being
        populated with components coming from <a href="ext:batik">Apache Batik</a>
        and <a href="ext:fop">Apache FOP</a>. Stay tuned for exciting treasures made
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Wiki, we have a 
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/xmlgraphics/XmlGraphicsCommonComponents">plan for building Apache XML Graphics Commons</a>.
        The plan provides an idea of what you can expect to find here when we're finished 
        migrating components.
